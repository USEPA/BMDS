At dose = 5 ppm, the ilc+ models do a better job at predicting the number of litters with 0 or 1 responding litters compared the ilc- models. These plots can be used to compare model predictions of fit at each individual dose group or across all doses.  In particular, it appears that the failure of the ilc- models to adequately predict the number of litters with 0 - 5 responding fetuses in the 15 ppm dose group may be driving the observation of p-values < 0.10 for those models."
