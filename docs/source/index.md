**pybmds** is a Python package for executing the U.S. EPA Benchmark Dose Modeling Software (BMDS). The package includes dose-response models for multiple types of dose-response data, including dichotomous, continuous, nested dichotomous, and tumor (as well as multitumor modeling). The pybmds library is designed for those familiar with scripting to conduct dose-response modeling.

**BMDS Desktop** is an application for running dose-response modeling using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) locally. The **bmds-ui** Python package installs BMDS Desktop; it can also be used to deploy an application online, such as the U.S. EPA's [BMDS Online](https://bmdsonline.epa.gov) deployment.

This guide describes the use and installation of both **pybmds** and **BMDS Desktop**.

:::{admonition} NOTE - this will not work until we officially release!
:class: caution

The content below below will not work until we are cleared for public release; please follow the detailed [installation guide](./installation.md). This message will be removed prior to official release.

---

To install **BMDS Desktop** (which includes `pybmds`):

```bash
pip install bmds-ui
```
:::

Please follow the [installation guide](./installation.md) if you plan on seriously using `pybmds` or BMDS Desktop for work on multiple projects; the guide makes it easier to setup multiple versions, and describes in detail how upgrade or uninstall existing versions, and describes possible issues and solutions that may arise during installation.

**Highlights:**

* Dose response modeling for multiple dataset types (continuous, dichotomous, nested dichotomous, multitumor)
* Plotting and summary tables capabilities
* Model recommendation logic
* Reporting in standard Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word reports
* Batch execution for multiple datasets or option set configuration

Example use the `pybmds` software to run a dose-response session:

```python
import pybmds

dataset = pybmds.DichotomousDataset(
   doses=[0, 10, 50, 150, 400],
   ns=[25, 25, 24, 24, 24],
   incidences=[0, 3, 7, 11, 15],
)
session = pybmds.Session(dataset=dataset)
session.add_default_models()
session.execute()
session.plot(colorize=True)
```
