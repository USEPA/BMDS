python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

# build
make build     # recompile source for development of pybmds package

# test local install

# code formatting
make lint      # identify formatting errors
make format    # fix formatting errors when possible

# testing
make test      # run tests

```bash
# build c++ code
cmake ..
make

# run all tests
make run_tests
